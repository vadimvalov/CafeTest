## **FORM OPEN BY PRESSING "Add +" BUTTON**

The idea of this project is to **immediately display** the **analysis** of the received data, and adding them is the form. 

In general, it turns out to be something like SPA, but **not SPA**, because **I'm still learning** React. ***Probably***, from my side, I can prescribe **further functionality** of the site, in addition to just verification of the form and output of the graph. That's why the site is on version one. 

**To compile the project:**
`npm run dev`
Press `O` 

The project uses CDNs, which obviously won't work for prod, but it seems speed is the deciding factor at this stage, and so I didn't mess with npm packages
